### Power BI Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Visualization

---

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This project involves analyzing **IPL (Indian Premier League) data** downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset was imported into **Power BI**, where I performed **data cleaning** and **data transformation** using Power BI's **Transform Data** method. I created **calculated columns** using **DAX functions** and built a dynamic **Power BI dashboard** with various visualizations to uncover insights and trends from the dataset.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Data Source**: Kaggle (IPL Dataset)
- **Visualization Tool**: Power BI
- **Data Transformation**: Power BI's Transform Data feature
- **Calculated Columns**: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- **Visualization Types**: Bar charts, Line charts, Pie charts, Cards, etc.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. **Data Import**:
   - The IPL dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle** and imported into **Power BI**.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:
   - Performed **data cleaning** to handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Used **Power BI Transform Data** to transform data types, filter unnecessary columns, and structure the data for analysis.

3. **Calculated Columns**:
   - Created new calculated columns using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to enhance the dataset. For example:
     - **Total Runs**: Calculated based on individual player performances.
     - **avrege run**: Derived from the formula `(Total Runs / total Balls ) * 100`.
     - EXT.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Designed an interactive **dashboard** to visualize key insights. The dashboard includes:
     - **Bar Charts**: Showing top run scorers, wicket-takers, etc.
     - **Line Charts**: Tracking player performance across seasons.
     - **Pie Charts**: Team-wise win distribution.
     - **Card Visuals**: Highlighting key statistics like total runs, wickets, and match wins.
     - **Slicers**: Added for dynamic filtering (e.g., by team, player, or season).

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Visuals

- **Top 10 Batsmen Performance**: Bar chart comparing total runs scored by players.
- **Winning Teams Overview**: Pie chart showing win percentages by team.
- **Performance Trends**: Line chart displaying player performance trends across IPL seasons.
- **Key Metrics**: Cards displaying total ball,run ,six,four,three,double ,singles  of matches, wickets taken, and runs scored.
